# Open Operating System BY Kuunal Prajapati

* It is only a learing project not for production.
* You can try it without any permissions.
* If you want to make any change make it and let me know so that we can build it further together.
* In future I will also try to release a full featured version of it.

## Prerequisite
* Understanding of C/C++.
* Familiar with Ubuntu (linux Environment).
* A lot of patience ( not al thing works as expected and it take a lot of hardwork to make it work).

## My building environment
* Ubuntu 24.04 ( WSL2 in Windows 10)
* Visual Studio code (For Code)
* Virtual box in Windows 10 to test iso


 For running Ubuntu in wsl you can fing tons of tutorial and documentaion online and all the setup

## Required Packages
Not necessary required to build every operating sytem. Because you can build your operating system with some other programming language or environment.
All tese projects are for this project only.

* g++
* binutils
* libc6-dev-i386
* grub-legacy or grub
* xorriso

These are only few but i recommned you to install comlete gcc toolchain to get a better devlopment experience.

## How To Use

Just go and run the command make run. <br>
Also keep in mind to change the Makefile to get iso in desire directory. <br>
This directory is according to my PC so change it according to your PC and it's environment to avoid any problem.<br>
After executing last command 
```bash
make run
```
You will get an iso file. You can either make a bootable CD/DVD or Pendrive/FlashDrive (not Recommecnded) or just create a virtual machine to test the operating system. 
>**Note** :<br> 
> *If it does not create iso file check your environment and Makefile . Happy CodingüòÅ*
